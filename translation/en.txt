[00:15.66] There were tears I never showed anyone There were tears I shed in secret
[00:40.55] It was never a smooth road, but it was certainly the path I walked.
[00:54.05] 
[01:03.84] Still on the path to the dream I envisioned back then
[01:15.20] In the midst of a dream I nearly gave up on time and time again
[01:23.70] 
[01:32.16] After countless days passed Here we are, having arrived at this moment
[01:43.81] So just move forward without hesitation.
[01:50.27] Toward the Bridge of Glory
[01:53.77] 
[01:59.33] There were nights when I was so frustrated I couldn't sleep.
[02:10.08] There was a night when I trembled with fear.
[02:16.58] 
[02:22.31] Even when I felt like giving up, when everything seemed unbearable and I wanted to run away,
[02:34.34] Looking back, I see how I've walked this path surrounded by so much support.
[02:46.34] 
[02:51.22] Beyond sorrow and pain There is light for each of us
[03:02.81] Come on, let's go. Just start running without looking back.
[03:09.46] Toward the sky filled with hope
[03:13.46] 
[03:40.76] There were tears I never showed anyone There were tears I shed in secret
[03:53.26] 
[04:10.85] After countless days passed Here we are, having arrived at this moment
[04:22.31] So just move forward without hesitation.
[04:29.07] Toward the Bridge of Glory
[04:35.12] To that never-ending journey
[04:41.60] To the bridge leading to your heart
